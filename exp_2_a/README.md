# Experiment 2 - Part A: **Exploring Flutter Widgets**
[![Try APK](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try%20APK-Download-blue)](#file:exp_2_a.apk)

## Aim
To explore various Flutter widgets such as `Text`, `Image`, and `Container`.

## Objective
In this lab experiment, we will explore various Flutter widgets such as `Text`, `Image`, and `Container`. Follow the steps below to set up a basic Flutter application and customize it according to your needs.

## System Requirements
- **Flutter SDK**: version 2.0.0 or higher
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code (Supported) or android studio (Supported) or IntelliJ IDEA (Supported).
- **Operating System**: Windows (7 or higher), macOS (10.12 or higher), or Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, or similar)

## Procedure

1. Create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```cmd
    flutter create my_flutter_app
    ```
    The command creates a Flutter project directory called `my_flutter_app` that contains a simple demo app that uses [Material Components](https://m3.material.io/components).

2. Change to the Flutter project directory.
    ```cmd
    cd my_flutter_app
    ```
3. Open the `lib/main.dart` file in your Flutter project.

4. Replace the existing code with the following code snippet:

    ```dart
    void main() {
    runApp(const MainApp()); // Run the MainApp widget as the root of the application
    }

    class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
    const MainApp({super.key}); // Constructor for the MainApp widget

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return MaterialApp( // Create a MaterialApp widget
        home: Scaffold(
            body: Center(
            child: Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the column vertically
                children: [
                const Text( // Display a text widget with the given text
                    'Welcome to Flutter!',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
                const SizedBox(height: 16),
                Image.asset( // Display an image from the assets folder
                    'assets/images/flutter_logo.png',
                    width: 200, // Set the width, height of the image
                    height: 200,
                ),
                const SizedBox(height: 16),
                Container( // Create a container widget
                    width: 200,
                    height: 50,
                    color: Colors.blue, // Set the background color of the container
                    child: const Center(
                    child: Text( // Display a text widget
                        'Start',
                        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Set the text color
                    ),
                    ),
                ),
                ],
            ),
            ),
        ),
        );
    }
    }
    ```
5. Get the image `flutter_logo.png` from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Google-flutter-logo.png) and save it in the `assets/images/` directory of your Flutter project or replace the image path `'assets/images/flutter_logo.png'` with the actual path to your image file and then save the file.

6. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file in your Flutter project and add the following lines after `flutter:` to include the image asset in your project:

    ```yaml
    flutter:
      uses-material-design: true
      assets: <-- Add this line
        - assets/images/flutter_logo.png <-- Add this line
    ```
    Save the file.

7. Run your Flutter project using the following command:
    ```cmd
    flutter run
    ```
    Select the appropriate device to run the app.

8.  - Enter `r` to hot reload the app and see the changes you made to the code.
    - Enter `q` to quit the app.
